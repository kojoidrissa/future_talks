#Rock Star/Ninja alternatives
This list was inspired by the following tweet:

>Why's it always a "Rock Star Developer" and never "Smooth Jazz Engineer" or a "Pop Star Coder"

>Besides .... "Disco Star Dev" sounds better - [Rod Boothby](https://twitter.com/rod11/status/597980533654683648) on Twitter

So, what names do I like? And what can new developers learn from looking at these different, mostly fictional roles I've dreamt up?

THIS has turned into a talk about how the K/J-Pop industries can be used as a guide to structuring your dev teams and/or startups.  The martial arts thing may have to be separate.

##New Music Thesis
Asian Idol groups can show you how to structure your dev teams or companies. None of this is "too foreign", as the original idea was taken from the US entertainment industry, then refined.

###K-Pop
+  Items from K-Pop Idol list
+  Trainee system: Invest in developing new developers
    +  eliminates the "we don't have enough good developers" issue. Grow your own
    +  try to instill a focus on virtuosity & craftsmanship. See G-Soul.
-  Upward mobility options?
    +  Shinhwa --> Teen Top
    +  Kangta
-  Unit groups & solo work can paradoxically contribute to group longevity. How big would N'Sync be if they were a K-Pop group? 


###J-Pop
