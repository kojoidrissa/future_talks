#TDCD Test Driven Career Development
Potential PyCon talk

In Nov. 2012, I decided to get serious about becoming a Python dev. I took a class, wrote code at work, started presenting at meetups, etc. by 2015, I was presenting at DjangoCon. I almost didn't survive into 2016.

I explain the basics of TDD & how I could've used it  to avoid errors in my career change.  Also, finding tests you didn't KNOW you needed when you started coding. Or developing your career.

##Outline
-  Software Testing
-  Career Changing
-  Both!

Can I DO this?
-  [I would got Freelancer.com and pick a job, then code it and put it in my Github. And then I'd be like, "I didn't get the job, but I made this."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDvToOqb6VA&t=42m18s)
