#TDCD Test Driven Career Development
Potential PyCon talk

In Nov. 2012, I decided to get serious about becoming a Python dev. I took a class, wrote code at work, started presenting at meetups, etc. by 2015, I was presenting at DjangoCon. I almost didn't survive into 2016.

I explain the basics of TDD & how I could've used it  to avoid errors in my career change.  Also, finding tests you didn't KNOW you needed when you started coding. Or developing your career.

I've recently changed careers into software development. This talk will introduce the fundamentals of software testing to novice developers. It will also show how those concepts can be used to help people successfully change careers into Python development. 

##Outline
What is "testing"?
-------------------
-  Defined
-  Functional vs Integration testing

    +  I'll focus on Integration testing
   
Why would I do this? When do I start?
--------------------
-  It's never too early to start testing of some sort
-  Code works now, don't break it if you add to it
-  {Typin' and Hopin'} < {Software Engineering}
   
How would I do this?
--------------------
-  Concepts
    -  What are you testing? What are you looking for?
    -  How you do know if something "works" or not?
-  Python's built-in tools
    -  Doctest
    -  Unittest

Career Changing
----------------
-  Applying the concepts to your career change
    -  What are you looking for?
    -  What are your "success conditions"?
    -  How will you know if/when you've met them?

Can I DO this?
-  [I would go to Freelancer.com and pick a job, then code it and put it in my Github. And then I'd be like, "I didn't get the job, but I made this."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDvToOqb6VA&t=42m18s)
