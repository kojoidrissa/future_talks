#Inclusion 102: The Hard Work Part

>[NO ONE can tolerate a Brilliant Asshole for long. Even OTHER Brilliant Assholes. Apply this idea to your organization.](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/597181881554108416)

What this means is that no matter HOW "*brilliant*" a Brilliant Asshole is, they'll drive other people out of your organization.

One thing I didn't mention in that tweet is that Brilliant Asshole's are also fairly 'fragile'. They're prone to pouting, rage quitting or other juvenile behavior if they don't get their way. You can't build an organization around them.
