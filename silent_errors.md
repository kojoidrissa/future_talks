#Silent errors

Tech Community culture talk inspired by the Zen of Python
`Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced.`

Diversity in tech isn't a pipeline problem, it's a "hostile environment" problem. It's also a, "I didn't realize that WAS a problem" problem. That's because too many of the 'errors' pass silently.

This talk was inspired by the MANY examples I found of this while working on my DjangoCon 2015 Inclusion talk. It MAY be the foundation of my PyTexas 2015 talk.

All the times that non-hetero CISgendered white males in a certain age range get pushed away or turned off by the prevailing tech culture.
